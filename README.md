# My Personal Site 

### Why?
 I wanted to create a space where I could organize and showcase all the cool things I have done, and make an easy way for people to learn more about me!
 
 ### When?
 I have been learning web developement for a few years, but my learning really accelerated over the summer of 2020 when I built this website! 
 
 ### Where?
 You can find my site at [sloansobie.com](https://www.sloansobie.com)
 
 ### How?
 I had a small background in programming previously, but I mainly taught myslef the skills I needed as I went along making the website!
